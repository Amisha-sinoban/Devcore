# 100 Days of DevCore

Welcome to my 100 Days of LeetCode, Competitive Programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) repository! This is where I track my journey towards becoming proficient in solving algorithmic problems and preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

## üöÄ About This Repository:

This repository contains my daily coding practice across LeetCode, Codeforces, and various other platforms, focused on:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, Graph Algorithms, etc.
- **Competitive Programming**: My solution attempts for contests on Codeforces, LeetCode Weekly Contests, and other platforms.
- **Mock Interviews**: Time-bound problem-solving sessions mimicking real interview scenarios.

## üìÖ My 100-Day Plan:

In this repository, I am following a structured 100-day plan, aiming to:

- Solve 3-5 problems every day to cover a broad range of topics and gradually increase the difficulty level.
- Focus on medium to hard-level problems as I progress to enhance my problem-solving skills.
- Analyze and optimize each solution to improve efficiency and learn different approaches to problems.

## üìà Progress and Milestones:

- **Day 1 - Day 30**: Focus on foundational topics (arrays, strings, basic dynamic programming).
- **Day 31 - Day 60**: Dive deeper into advanced topics (trees, graphs, advanced DP, greedy algorithms).
- **Day 61 - Day 100**: Focus on mock interviews, time-bound problem-solving, and system design practice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Platforms Used:

- **LeetCode**: For algorithmic problem-solving and interview practice.
- **Codeforces**: To improve speed and efficiency in competitive programming contests.
- **HackerRank**: For practice on data structures and algorithms.
- **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**: For learning and revising key concepts in algorithms and problem-solving.
- **VS Code**: My go-to IDE for coding practice.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Contribute:

Feel free to explore the solutions and improve them. If you have any suggestions for better approaches or optimizations, please open an issue or submit a pull request. If you‚Äôre also on a similar journey, let's connect and collaborate on problems!

## üå± Goals:

- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- Achieve mastery in data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for coding interviews with top tech companies.
